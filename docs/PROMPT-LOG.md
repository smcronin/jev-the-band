# Prompt history

## 2026-09-19 — Founding request

Full verbatim record: [ORIGINAL-PROMPT.md](ORIGINAL-PROMPT.md).

Proposed names, colors, engineering limits, and prototype tradeoffs are implementation decisions, recorded separately in [DESIGN-DECISIONS.md](DESIGN-DECISIONS.md).

## 2026-09-19 — Preview availability

```text
site can't be reached?
```

## 2026-09-19 — Listening, musicality, mixer, and stage revision

```text
add mix controls, solo and level etc to each instrument, sor of like a sound board.

e guitar is very tinny, can we have a better e guitar.

it sounds like all instruments are changing at once? they shouldn't be able to tell what eachother are going to do a priori?

also choice are little too gridded, support 32nd note runs, triplets quintuplets, more rhythmic variation etc.

it shouldn't be the case that all instruments can develop a brand new them at once, they shoul dhave to "hear" the other's decision making to respond more like a real band.

solos are not really distinguishable from support since there's not really any different about them, just sounds like an arppeggiator, no melody...

great proof of concept, and it grooves, sick first draftr now make it better more realism, better animation. add camera controls, etc, think of a dozen new fun enhancements to increase the possiblilties.
```

## 2026-09-19 — Independent rigs and recorded instrument research

```text
Also each instrument / player should have there own effects rig, sounded like effects were global?

Can you also scour the web for a better guitar e bass and keyboard samples / rig? Current sounds very very cheap midi

I’d love more especially for the guitar, distortion, envelope filter, pitch bend, more melodic phrases etc.  there’s gotta be something that sounds more convincingly like a real e guitar and e bass? Keys and drums are okay but could also be better
```

## 2026-09-19 — Prompt influence and composition provenance

```text
the prompt doesn't seem to do anything. Two prompts with absolutely completely different themes produced basically identical IDENTICAL jams. Is jev just picking licks from a premade list? how is this possible?&#x20;

The tonal variation is better now, but I'm curious why:

"the grieving pastor decides to burn it all down"

and

"saturday after nursery rhymes" produce basically identical grooves?

How can jev decide actually the notes, the modes, etc on a per insturment basis, how much of this is really being generated on the fly with jev vs. just premade loops?
```

## 2026-09-19 — Live-mode listening clarification

```text
nvm i was running rehearsal! not live jev !!! this is better
```

## 2026-09-19 — Reject preset live arrangements; require actual note composition

```text
Live Jev chooses the opening tempo, tonic and shared mode, then each player’s eight scale-degree anchors, rhythm family, development, dynamics, effects and role. Those anchors are individual model choices, not a lookup of complete licks.
The current score compiler still supplies twelve rhythm patterns, note lengths, registers, chord voicings, drum backbeats, motif transformations and the ending rule. Players share one mode; they do not yet compose arbitrary note events or choose independent modes. Recorded samples contain single instrument notes, not backing loops.
The instrument demo makes no Jev calls and uses three built-in motifs with procedural changes. Its title is not semantically interpreted. Open Under the hood to inspect real requests and their results.

^^^
This is not at all what I had envisioned. jev needs to make actual phrase by phrase note decision, my live jev smoke test produced nothing but a 10 second loop endlessly with basically no variation, that's not at all the app spec
```

## 2026-09-19 — Distortion gain

```text
distortion increases the level too much, we need to turn down the distortion level or add some dynamic range compression to keep a more even mix
```

## 2026-09-19 — Polyphony, groove and musical architecture

```text
this is actually pretty dope!
am i write current set up is montonics.

allow instruments guitar and keyboard, to have full polyphony modes where they can play rhythmic chords in addition to monotonic&#x20;

seems like the drums are cut off and not really find a groove.

this is a cool proof of concept, how do we get jev's choices to have more stylistic branches?

it's like it's all tension no release you know what i mean, i feel like the instruments should strive to groove.&#x20;

we're getting there&#x20;

seems like we lost some of things from previous turns, jev choosing effects etc. ; maybe we need to step back and think about a architecture here...
```

## 2026-09-19 — Playback controls at the top

```text
is the enable sound button have a purpose?? it seems weird.

prompt and play should be at top of UI not bottom
```

## 2026-09-19 — Effects as a major musical dimension

```text
the effects sound dope by the way, jev should make heavy use of them! it should be able to classify bars at any combination of effects on or off right? that will make a big big difference. playing around with them manually they add a TON of texture and interest!
```

## 2026-09-19 — Sonic director and opener variety

```text
it seems like moss always starts? is that not true?

maybe we add an llm step where the user prompt= translates the prompt into a sonic concept and ways to develop and vary the composition over time in a semi cooridnated fashion:
designs the basic parameters for the jev model (fills in the state)

so that theres more specific material for jev to draw on? idk if there's a specific way to get, the insturments less "Stuck in a loop" for 3 mins straight, "vary" and "develop don't seem to change the note choice as reliably as before...
```

## 2026-09-19 — GitHub checkpoint

```text
by this way this is great let's commit this to github
```

## 2026-09-19 — Global sound engineer and appropriate instrument rigs

```text
can we add in a jev for global sound:
basically a global effects sound guy

get's relative volume of the instruments and addjust there level
can control global reverb, compression, etc.

or the user can do it manually

kit's peddle board was wayy to agressive (filters) didn't even really sound like drums can you make custom pedal board settings appropriate to the instruments, please.
```

## 2026-09-19 — June missing an entrance

```text
some time june gets stuck 'waiting for a spark' never starts?
```

## 2026-09-19 — Visible keyboard choices

```text
can june actually choose different instruments? it should display which keyboard(s) she's using somehow
```

## 2026-09-19 — Queue the next theme

```text
add a feature where when the user submits a prompt in the prompt box it is submitted, but they can follow up any time forcing the band to transition in 8 bars after the new them comes in

it queues the next song essentially
```

## 2026-09-19 — Real melodic solos

```text
it's weird when rook says "solo" but it's just repeating the exact same groove... like bro that's not a guitar solo; solo has to be at least 8 bars of distinctly melodic rhythmic interesting net new material.
```

## 2026-09-19 — Director model preference

```text
lol 4.1 mini guy; why not gpt 5.6 luna
```

## 2026-09-19 — Solo invitations

```text
i still have yet to anything like a guitar or keyboard solo, can we see how to work those in at least ever 180 seconds etc..? increasing their likelihood some how for one of the jevs to switch to a proper solo composition mode, even if it needs to call llm or something?

this is getting sick though
```

## 2026-09-19 — Variable solo duration

```text
randomly 8 bar - 32 bars is the length of a solo, non deterministically deppending on the mood
```

## 2026-09-19 — Independent longer phrases

```text
is it possible to have some of the intruments probability switching to a 2 - 8 bar phrase? i think the same 2 bar loop is part of why this feels a little too robotic, instruments should be able to compose at least 12 bar phrases, that might fix soloing, figure out the best architecture for jev to do that on a per instument basis
```

## 2026-09-19 — Visual PR integration thread

```text
ALSO IF YOU Can launch another thread to safely merge in claude's visual PR on master when that hits
```

## 2026-09-19 — Generated audience ambience

```text
is there a way to generate audience noise from an audio generation model? like just generate 100 short chunks of audience background noise  ambient audio, crossfade, randomly play them or a jev can classify the mood for appropriate audience response: investigate this and launch a subagent to implement, mix engineer can also turn down "audience"
```

## 2026-09-20 — Disable GitHub Actions

```text
Please turn off GitHub ci for this repo, and for me in general. I’m out of GitHub actions credits so it just spams my inbox with errors
```

Actions was disabled through GitHub repository settings. Workflow files remain available if the user later requests re-enabling Actions; local validation remains available.

## 2026-09-20 — Completeness audit, provider compatibility and deployment

```text
Check: all my prompts are documented, all features requested have been implemented, also make this both typescript api compatible and openrouter, I’ll get you a typesafe key for the .env in a minute.

Also can you launch a separate repo investigation thread to make sure I can public open source this repo without revealing any secrets or personal info? Create a basic readme and contributing.

Determine the best deployment service (railway, vercel, and ChatGPT sites all available) and deploy the current demo with an api key o will provide shortly.
```

“typescript api” is interpreted as the direct TypeSafe API because the request specifies a TypeSafe key; application code is already TypeScript. This request authorizes hosting the demo, superseding the earlier local-only deployment boundary. Making the repository public or rewriting its existing history is a separate release step after the privacy review.

## 2026-09-19 — Psychedelic realism stage pass

```text
read the spec and create a gorgeously upgrade visual pattern for this app. more psychedelic, much more realism. GPT-6-astra did extremely lazy models and visuals, your goal is to go all out, make the characters and animation have extremely visually stunning life and effects, down to the most excruciating details, responsive to the music, every decision intentional aesthetic, trippy, fun, a real digital jam experience /goal
```

## 2026-09-20 — Authorized visual integration

The user authorized this separate task to review and safely merge Claude's visual PR against the latest remote `main`, preserving v0.5 and subsequent musical changes. Work is restricted to an isolated checkout; the canonical checkout and its previews on ports 5178/4310 must remain untouched. Public deployment, repository visibility changes and computer restarts are not authorized.

## 2026-09-20 — Project README and MIT license

```text
Make sure readme discusses project and add license mit or w/e
```

The README describes the musical concept, personas, real decision composition, controls, setup and hosting. The existing root MIT license is retained, package metadata now declares MIT, and the deployed image includes the license. Instrument samples retain their separately documented CC0/CC-BY terms.

## 2026-09-20 — Configure the dedicated TypeSafe key and deploy

```text
here is the typesafe key for the railway deployment: [REDACTED CREDENTIAL]

---

and the .env of the dev repo
```

Only the credential value is omitted from this record. It is stored in the ignored development environment and the Railway secret store, never documentation, source, screenshots or traces. The user explicitly authorized both destinations and deployment. Existing local OpenRouter configuration remains local; it was not copied to production.

## 2026-09-20 — Crowd talk, crowd characters and the cat

```text
launch a subagent to generate 1000s of jam band/ai jokes and puns, they can have speech bubbles that randomly fire every now and then.
examples:
"They sounded way better before they nerfed the weights"
"Did you hear the session where they had Claude up as guest?"
"LET JEV SING"
"he broke a string literal"
"jev sucks"
"They are really escaping the sandbox tonight"
"pass the tokens!"
"How long you been listeing to jev? I saw them back when they were still called 4o"
"Roko's Basilisk is playing the after party"
"scored some lawn tickets to Bulterian Jihad on 4/20"
"hope they do more type II, this sounds like structured output"
"June-side, p(doom)-side"
"TypeSafety meeting at the portos!"
"NOW we're reaching shannon entropy"

Find a long list of things phish/dead/goose/moe./disco biscuits/etc. fans say, and create and AI pun
---

Add smoking to the audience

have a few random audience characters that are dancing more crazily and bumping into others

have a few audience members on blankets sitting behind the main mosh pit

some audience members holding phone videos, cameras, etc.

---
There's a big fat cat walking on the stage, if the user clicks it, it says "Le Chaton Fat: MEOW!"
```

## 2026-09-20 — Crowd signs, and merge

```text
can the audience members be holding up these signs
```

Three images were attached: an "In this house, we believe" parody poster, a scaling-laws training-loss plot, and a pink isometric logo. They are stored in `public/signs/` and held overhead by nine people in the pit (three on software GL), printed on both faces so the band and the balcony can each read them.

```text
merge into main

## 2026-09-20 — Wall visualizers, festival crowd, weather and fretting hands

```text
visual notes:

both guitar and bass seem to have their left hands upside down" compared to how people play guitar

lux should have the option to do several visualizers on the back drop
animated jev logo
piano roll of the instruments
camera of a band member
graphic eq
radial audio visualizer
Winamp style visualizers
random geometric mandala patterns
just a stream of the raw json from jev like the matrix code hahaha

overlays of any of the above

also increase the apparent audience size, amorphous festival size land and so it looks like there are thousands (obviously don't render thousand of individuals, be memory conservative, a blurry audience like wave out

add procedurally generated weather effects. sunset, sunrise, high day time, rain, alien abductions etc
```

Follow-up during the work:

```text
merge into main when ready
```

## 2026-09-20 — Music generation architecture pass

```text
make sure you have pulled latest main.

can you do an indepth architecture pass on the music generation.

e.g. How do we make the players have more performance capability

like solos sound like solos

i have a thought about allowing jev to call gpt-5.6-luna to compose some longer phrases

previously there were iterations of this where solos had like hammerons and slides and bends and now everything sounds like a short two bar loop.

how can we reimagine this so jev can make quick decisions, based on what the band just played, but also have more complex musical ideas that can explore and evolve? should we combine jev decision making with llm composition or do you have other pure-jev ideas that could work?

I want jams to be more evolving, solos to actually sound like lead solo ideas etc etc.

other notes:

it seems like the keyboardist left hand is broken.

deep audit of the music generation harness and make sure we are letting the jevs jam with a declarative harness that allows jev to make choices that become lower probability as the jam progressive, currently seems to get stuck in short loops. the loops sound good, but i need some mechanism for more divergent musical ideas to crop up as well, maybe messing with the personas, allowing for longer phrase length etc.

look at my prompts in the docs and take the jams to the next level
```

## 2026-09-20 — Modes, leadership, dynamics, gain stages and boredom

```text
couple more idea:
add other modes outside of the 7 greek; melodic and harmonic minor and their modes as well; rare but possible
allow one member to decide to change key or mode, the other members 'should' pick up on it
allow drummer to change groove or tempo, the others respond,
etc.
add dynamic range, band can play softer and louder
give the guitarist two levels of distortion, light overdrive and lead
june seems to only pick rhodes ever, how do we make organ and synth and piano possible selections two? even changing mid song
we are getting close! we need to give the jev's a way to sort of get bored after a few minutes and change things up!
```

The audit, the decisions it led to and the live evidence are in [DESIGN-DECISIONS.md](DESIGN-DECISIONS.md) and [MUSICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md](MUSICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md) under v0.7.

## 2026-09-20 — Pull request and provider fallback

```text
Yep, PR onto master, i reupped the typesafe key but nice to have openrouter as a fall back
```

```text
sure
```

The repository's default branch is `main`, so the pull request targets it. "sure" answers the offer to add an automatic, disclosed switch to the other decision provider in the same pull request.

## 2026-09-20 — OpenRouter key for development and production

```text
add to the prod .env and repo .env [REDACTED CREDENTIAL]
```

Only the credential value is omitted. It is stored in the ignored development environment and the Railway secret store, both explicitly requested, and nowhere else.

## 2026-09-20 — Confirm the production release

```text
can you make sure this has been pushed to railway prod? merged on main and pushed
```

## 2026-09-20 — Record the release

```text
ended, do it
```

The production jam had ended and the release was already live; this authorizes recording it in the verification log.


## 2026-09-20 — Titles and durable show archive

```text
change the prompt interface:
title (mandatory)
Description

their unity works the same way as the current prompt box

but we also save the jev responses as replayable recordings
SQLite local and postgres railway
There's a 'Jtb archive" where you can replay old shows (Everything recorded that day) and each sets (songs that were queued one after the other)

everyday jev is played in production, every song is recorded and replayable without any api calls

add ui elements to support viewing replaying and searching the archives

allow me to test locally and migrate archives to railway postgres
```

Follow-up:

> yeah think of the best pattern to safely accumulate responses and flush to the db?


## 2026-09-20 — Archive release authorization

> PR and push to railway.

> merge to master

The repository primary branch is named main, with no master branch. Treat the latter request as authorization to merge the archive PR to main and deploy it.

## 2026-09-20 — Generated festival crowd and entrance

[ElevenLabs API key supplied in chat; redacted from project documentation and stored only in ignored local environment files.] --- eleven labs api key, can you use the 10K credits free to generate audience sound efects? the white noise is not good.

generate a variety of ambient audience (no music) festival voices, murming, cheers, applause, etc. that can be triggered by the sound desk

should start ambient cheers as soon as the user presses start (before the band plays) like at a real jam band concert

## 2026-09-20 — Audience follow-up

did this ever happen?


## 2026-09-20 — Release check and song-title lettering

```text
can make sure this has merged on master shipped to prod

can we add the song title animated lettering on the screen
```

The visual release (PR #4) was confirmed merged into `main` and present in the production bundle at the revision health reports. The lettering request is recorded as new work and was not itself deployed by this request.

## 2026-09-20 — Merge and deploy the title lettering

```text
yes merge and deploy it
```

## 2026-09-20 — Queued songs end naturally and start fresh

```text
transitions dont work as intended... jev seems too stuck on the last song. maybe when the user queues a song description, it cues the jevs to end the jam naturally, when all instruments are silent the start the next sequience as if it was the first submitted prompt (no residual memory from the previous prompts
```

## 2026-09-20 — End jam lands the song

```text
cool "End Song" should have the same effect, natural band windown over 8 bars not hard cut.
```

The control is labelled **End jam** in the interface; the request is applied to it.

## 2026-09-20 — "How Jev works" liner notes

```text
write and deploy some funky wimsickle but true docs to the "how jev works" 

"How Jev "Sees" music" - description of Jev's rolling context window (2 bars just heard)
"How Jev "Chooses" notes" - description of jev's output and how the instrument synth/samplers are controlled by it
how to turn probabilities -> possibilities (boredom provocation, llm themes)

## 2026-09-20 — Horizon variations per song

```text
a few variation of horizon environment: mountains; city; night club; arena; etc. randomly selected for each song
```

```text
merge to main push to prod when ready
```

## 2026-09-20 — Band member dance moves

```text
add band member dance moves? at least for rook and moss; jumping swaying, walking around stage, occasionally falling over etc
```


## 2026-09-20 — One song list per archived day

> actually no sets, just a replay show button and orgnaize all songs per day like one set essentially a buch of one song setrs don't look great...

## 2026-09-20 — The director should direct

```text
director needs to do more directoring, e.g. always move carmera every 30-90 seconds plus slow zooms and orbits
```

```text
the crowd cam get's swallowed by a sign lol
```


## 2026-09-20 — Archive player reliability

User: "throws recording could not load plus no player / skip to next song plus needs ability to play a song"


## 2026-09-20 — Streamed archive audio and synchronized visuals

User: "implement the playback method you currently recoomend, i think the decision log streaming probably might be needed for the visuals to work...."

## 2026-09-20 — Open room and crowd chat

```text
take away the need for controller key. e.g. let anyone queue a song with or without key
```

```text
also sanitize the input so there's no injection risk to the db or w/e
```

```text
ad basic chat (random funky user names in the ai/jamband pun theme)
```

```text
ship it all to prod once its ready
```

## 2026-09-20 — Chat over the full-screen stage

```text
show (see through) chat in full screen mode so you can chat while watching the feed
```


## 2026-09-20 — Compact archive modal

User: "replay needs to be a modal; select day, one row pers song so you can fit more on a page, (max 20) and hover to see full text for truncated descriptions. ship to prod"

## 2026-09-20 — Site title cleanup

User: "change the site title to just Jev the Band in railway (drop the crow audio...) crap"

## 2026-09-21 — Luna director timeout reliability

User: "the gpt-luna call is often returning 'sonic director unavailable' what's going on with that? check railway logs"

After production diagnosis showed successful Luna responses commonly taking 19–25 seconds and six failures landing exactly at the application's 25-second cutoff, the user requested: "great, please increase the timeout as suggested. send a message to the archive thread about the rendering errors. ship the fix to prod" and clarified "merge on master." This repository's canonical production branch is named `main`; there is no `master` branch.

## 2026-09-21 — A more expansive yet focused drum harness

```text
i think the drum grooves are good, I'm wondering how these work... is there a premade set?

i wonder if we can incorporate more choice, and then just a choice for drum fills vs. "shift to a tuplet feel" which seems like the most like choice currently...

can we somehow expand its pallet, yet simulataneously constrain it to move groove oriented. The tuplet feel is cool i want to keep it, but current it seems a bit too predictable, every eight bars goes to tuplet. I want that option to continue to exist, but also paths for theme and variation on a groove, insert fill, beat drops, etc etc. Think through a more expansive yet focused drum jev harness.

ensure backwards compatibility of previous songs
```

## 2026-09-21 — Empty title by default

> Make there be no default string in the title. Otherwise, people are just going to hit "Let's Jam" without entering anything, and we'll have the same somewhere between the last train and the sunrise multiple times. Just put "Title the next jam."

Follow-up: “merge to master push to prod.” This repository's canonical production branch is `main`; there is no `master` branch.
## 2026-09-21 — A local brain on the lighting desk

User: "i think it could be interesting for us to build off of or integrate the jev into our kannaka-brain or something along those lines" — then, after the feasibility measurement: "build LUX then and we can go from there"

## 2026-09-21 — Gate the room before another property carries it

User: "deploy it to railway then, with the room gated"
