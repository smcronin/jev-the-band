/**
 * kannaka-shim.ts — a Jev that runs on your own machine.
 *
 * Jev's decision layer is a wire contract, not a model: a POST carrying closed
 * questions, a response carrying a distribution over each question's own
 * options, and five mechanical rules in `parseAnswers`. Anything that answers
 * that shape can hold an instrument. This answers it with a locally served
 * model — kannaka-brain on Ollama by default.
 *
 * It is a ROUTING PROXY rather than a replacement. A request it is configured
 * to take, it answers; anything else it forwards upstream untouched. That is
 * what lets one role move in-house without the band noticing, and it is why
 * nothing in `server/room.ts` changes: Jev is pointed at one endpoint, and the
 * endpoint decides who answers.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-21 (7B q4_K_M, Ollama, concurrency 8) against Jev's
 * 1.8 s abort: LUX answers its eight questions in about 0.93 s through the
 * running service, 1.17 s in the bare harness. The four musicians do not fit
 * yet — 2.4 to 2.7 s — so the default route is the lighting desk alone. Widen
 * KANNAKA_ROLES when the hardware earns it.
 *
 * The distribution is READ from the model's own logprobs over the option
 * letters, never asked for in prose. A model asked to state its confidence
 * states a number; a model read at the logits reveals one.
